# Highlightr Frontend
Highlightr is a twitch.tv clone with the additional feature of displaying highlights for past broadcasts. Highlights are found with a python script parsing through twitch chat for the particular broadcast. Chat is analyzed for timestamps with the highest peaks and specific terms found in comments.
